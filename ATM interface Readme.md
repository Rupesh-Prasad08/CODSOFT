The Java program represents a simple ATM interface that interacts with a user's bank account. It includes a class for the ATM, a class for the user's bank account, and methods for withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance. The user interface design includes options for withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance. The ATM class is connected to the user's bank account class to access and modify the account balance.

User input is validated to ensure it falls within acceptable limits. For example, the program validates that the user has a sufficient balance before allowing a withdrawal. Messages are displayed to the user based on their chosen options and the success or failure of their transactions. These messages provide feedback on the outcome of their actions, such as successful withdrawals, deposits, or insufficient funds. The program allows users to perform basic banking operations in a controlled and user-friendly manner.![Screenshot (154)](https://github.com/Rupesh-Prasad08/CODSOFT/assets/148632206/4ea03f3c-a476-4c61-894d-3545eb727a0e)
